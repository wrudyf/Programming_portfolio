<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Youâ€™ve been provided an implementation of Extort as presented in
class.</p>
<p>Racket 9.0 has decided to finally break with tradition and change the
behavior of <code>if</code>. No longer will it be possible to do
conditional evaluation using anything other than a bona fide boolean:
<code>#t</code> or <code>#f</code>.</p>
<p>Your job is make Extort work like the forthcoming Racket 9.0.</p>
<p>Update <code>interp.rkt</code> and <code>compile.rkt</code> so that
<code>if</code> works just like before when the first subexpression
evaluates to <code>#t</code> or <code>#f</code>, but signals an error
for any other value.</p>
<p>Note: none of the tests have been updated to reflect the new
behavior, so you will need to update the tests and may want to add your
own as well.</p>
