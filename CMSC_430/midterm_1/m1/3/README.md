# CMSC 430 Midterm 1, Part 3

## Instructions

You've been provided an implementation of Evildoer as presented in
class.

Your job is to implement two new expression forms:

- `(when e1 e2)`
- `(unless e1 e2)`

The expressions evaluate as follows:

- `(when e1 e2)` evaluates `e1`.

   * If `e1`'s value is true, i.e. any value other than `#f`, then
     `e2` is evaluated and its value is the value of the entire `when`
     expression.
   
   * If `e1`'s value is `#f`, then `e2` is *not* evaluated and the
     entire `when` expression evaluates to the void value.

- `(unless e1 e2)` evaluates `e1`.

   * If `e1`'s value is true, i.e. any value other than `#f`, then
     `e2` is not evaluated and the entire `unless` expression
     evaluates to the void value.
   
   * If `e1`'s value is `#f`, then `e2` is evaluated and its value is
     the value of the entire `unless` expression.

The AST type definition, parser, and interpreter have been updated to
implement these new forms, and a stub has been added to the
compiler. You must finish the implementation in the compiler.

Note: there are only a few `when` and `unless` tests included, so you
consider writing some of your own.
